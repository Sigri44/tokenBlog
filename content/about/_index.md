## Who am I?

I have followed the emergence of decentralized finance on Ethereum since its early days with the launch of MakerDAO. I'm fortunate to be able to get by in English - so I had access to resources to understand what was going on.

At the time, quality articles, videos or podcasts in French dealing with decentralized finance were rare. Thanks to the launch of [DeFi France](https://discord.gg/3bWZcK2) (October 2019), [BanklessFR](https://banklessfr.substack.com/) (March 2020), this blog (May 2020), and [TheDailyGweiFR](https://thedailygweifr.substack.com/) (November 2020), and many other initiatives, the situation has now changed. 

üá´üá∑ My ambition is to make decentralized finance more accessible to all: the mission is very broad, so let's be chauvinistic - I focus most of my action on the francophone community. Nevertheless, I remain sensitive to any initiative that helps to promote decentralized finance among international communities.

## What do I do?

I'm working to grow the Ethereum decentralized finance ecosystem by developing welcoming communities:

|  Logo | Project | Description | Function |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  ![paraswap](/img/others/paraswap.jpeg) | [üí± ParaSwap](https://paraswap.io) | The DeFi middleware abstracting the complexity required to deliver optimized token swaps for Dapp developpers and end-users. | Head of Propaganda |
|  ![DeFiFrance-logo](/img/others/defifrance-logo.png) | [üá´üá∑ DeFi France](https://discord.gg/3bWZcK2) | The original and leading grassroots Decentralised Finance meetup in Europe, held entirely in French to broaden accessibility. | Co-Organiser |
| ![Bankless-logo](/img/others/bankless.jpg) | [üí∏ BanklessFR](https://banklessfr.substack.com/) | The Bankless program blends money and tech insight to help you level up your open finance game every single week. | Coordinator |

### DeFi France

DeFi France is the main French-speaking community to exchange about decentralized finance. 

I host the weekly live shows that take place on **[Monday at 5pm on the YouTube channel DeFi France](https://www.youtube.com/c/defifrance)** - after a press review of the French-speaking DeFi, we analyze a transversal theme or a given project.

### ParaSwap

ParaSwap is a tool that allows the optimization of token exchanges via decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum network. It is directly accessible, but also integrable & usable by other decentralized applications.

I work to make ParaSwap as accessible as possible thanks to the development of ** [its user documentation: üìñ Learn2Swap](https://learn2swap.com/l2s/)**. Feel free to contact me to talk about swaps and how the ParaSwap API can be used.**

### BanklessFR

I was instrumental in getting BanklessFR off the ground, taken over by Jon and remains an active promoter - involved primarily at the community level.

### Previous Occupations

I was the Community Manager of [Monolith](https://monolith.xyz) for 18 months before I decided to focus on my community commitments. Since the beginning of my career, I have been working with startups to help them develop their online presence and implement sustainable digital strategies. 

Apart from decentralized finance, my technical expertise is focused on content production, community management and the logistics necessary to carry out these operations over time.
