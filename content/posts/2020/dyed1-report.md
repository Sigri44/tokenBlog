![Do-You-Even-DeFi-Cover](/img/others/dyed/DYED1-report.png)

Welcome DYED Trainees, I'm thrilled to have you on board!

So first, if you haven't yet, **[do join the dedicated Discord channel for the program](https://discord.gg/4zt75cb)**. You'll be able to ask your questions and discuss the adventures with other trainees.
Bonus: once you are in here, you'll be granted the DYED Trainee title, making it super easy for me to **ping you when a new mission goes live**.

### Observations

I'm really glad to see the diversity of means employed to fulfil this first mission, and especially the bonus part! The most commonly used non-custodial solutions were DEXs, unsurprisingly. However, some of you got really creative, especially one who found a way from BTC already!

It was also a great starter to **clear some misconceptions on what non-custodial means.** For instance, yes, a wallet like Argent is a non-custodial wallet. However, if a debit card is involved in the transaction - it means there is custody (the bank behind the card). Therefore it means that you can have custodial & trusted crypto purchasing solutions living within a non-custodial wallet. Thanks for helping me realize this is not obvious at all for a novice.

PS: Seems like quite a few Frenchies took me on my adventure/challenge. So to better gather for them - we've created a dedicated DYED-FR discussion channel.

### Next Steps

For logistical reasons mostly (I've been travelling), I haven't been able to catch up with Vincent (Monolith's DYED Trainee) for the first mission - so there will be no audio debrief for this first one. 

Thanks for indulging the quirks of me launching this right before taking a week of holidays (sound planing right there ðŸ˜‚). We'll do a proper debrief at the end of the week covering the first two missions.

Enjoy the rest of your Sunday, and I'll see you here and **[on the Discord](https://discord.gg/4zt75cb)** tomorrow for the next mission!
